OOP based hook library example.
```lua
local function ExampleHook()
lyx:HookCall("lyx_test", "Hello World!")            -- This or the hook.Run function can be used.
end

local test = lyx:HookStart("lyx_test", function(...)  -- Lets actually start the hook.
    local args = {...}                                -- This returns an ID for the hook to ease removing it.
    print(args[1])                                    -- Takes all arguments, you need to know what index to use.
end)                                                  -- This is a sort of example on how to access arguments.

ExampleHook()                                         -- Lets call the function to create a hook call.

lyx:HookRemove("lyx_test", test)                      -- Lets remove just to keep random hooks off the server.
```
